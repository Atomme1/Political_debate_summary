# GUI for voice recording and labeleling wav/txt data

AI needs to have data and label with the same name.

The purpose of this GUI is to make recording and labeling your own data easier.

Therefor you can record yourself, write the text you speak and save it directly with the same name (with the extension .wav and .txt)

## You use the GUI from top to bottom:
   - Create the folder for the data to be stored in
   - Write the name of the files ex: "tristan_oui_1"
   - Write the text you will speak ex: "oui!"
   - Record yourself (5 seconds of recording, can be changed in the py file)

### Use case 
If I type in "Hooray!" and say "Hooray" while naming the file "tristan_hooray_1"
It will generate:
   - tristan_hooray_1.txt
   - tristan_hooray_1.wav
